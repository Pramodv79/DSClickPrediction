**QUESTION**
Predict which recommended  content each user will click. In addition to prediction also identify significant features that drive the likely hood of user clicking the recommended content indicating association. 
 
We will use outbrains two weeks of data from 14-Jun-2016 and 28-jun-2016 provided on kaggle.  
 
The prediction of the models would be evaluated on test data according to the Mean Average Precision @12  (MAP@12):
MAP@12=1|U|∑u=1|U|∑k=1min(12,n)P(k)
 where |U| is the number of display_ids, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, n is the number of predicted ad_ids.   
 
This is a very large relational set ( 2B rows and 100GB uncompressed). If the large amount of data is unmanageable the data size may be reduced  1/10th so the project could be completed in the given timeframe. Expectation to complete this project is 8 Nov' 17 for peer review.
